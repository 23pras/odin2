    <h2>Description</h2>
    <br>
    <p>When we were kids, whenever my parents went out to an adults only party,
       my mother used to ask us what we wanted for dinner at home. 99% of the time, 
       our choice was pooris and shahi paneer. My mother was always nice enough to oblige. 
       Here is the recipe. 
       It is quite rich and hence a nice treat.</p>

       <li>Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</li><br>
       <li>When the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients like chopping tomatoes,

       <li>Crush 1-inch ginger + 3 to 4 medium-sized garlic to a paste in a mortar pestle to a semi-fine or fine paste.

       <li> Mix the cashew paste very well with the cooked tomato puree and continue to stir 
            and sauté on a low to medium-low flame.
